## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly. In this post, we explore the intersection of traditional data science and modern AI techniques.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Automation**: Routine tasks are being automated.
2. **Augmentation**: Data scientists are becoming more productive.
3. **New Frontiers**: Generative AI opens new possibilities.

## Code Example

Here is a Python snippet using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
print(df.mean())
```

## Math Example

We can use LaTeX to express complex formulas:

$$
E = mc^2
$$
